## Detailed Documentation

This project is organized into several key parts:

1. **Convex Configuration**  
   Located under the `convex` directory (e.g., `_generated/server.d.ts`), these files handle server-side logic and data models.

2. **UI Components**  
   The `src/components/ui` directory contains reusable UI elements. For example:

    - `alert-dialog.tsx` and `dialog.tsx` define modal-like components for alerts and dialogs.
    - Shared styles and variant handling are managed through utility functions like `cn()` and `buttonVariants()`.

3. **Constants**  
   Under `src/constants`, you’ll find items such as `templates.ts` that define sample content and references used across different parts of the application.

4. **Styling**  
   This project uses Tailwind CSS (configured in `postcss.config.mjs`). Run development mode to see real-time style changes.

5. **Next.js Structure**
    - Core routes and pages reside in an `app` directory or `pages` directory (depending on the Next.js version).
    - You can edit the main entry points (e.g., `app/page.tsx`) to modify or add pages.

To try it out locally, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Project Title & Description

This is a powerful document editing and management platform built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It helps users create, edit, and collaborate on documents in a modern, responsive UI.

### Features

- Real-time document creation and editing
- Reusable UI components (alerts, dialogs, etc.)
- Template-based content generation
- Server-side logic via Convex (e.g., `_generated/server.d.ts`)
